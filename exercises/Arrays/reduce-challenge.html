Overview
Supporting multiple hardware platforms
FIXME

Meaning: x86, x64, ARM, others?

For Python-only distributions, it *should* be straightforward to deploy on all
platforms where Python can run.

For distributions with binary extensions, deployment is major headache.  Not only
must the extensions be built on all the combinations of operating system and
hardware platform, but they must also be tested, preferably on continuous
integration platforms.  The issues are similar to the "multiple Python
versions" section above, not sure whether this should be a separate section.
Even on Windows x64, both the 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Python enjoy
significant usage.
OS packaging & installers
FIXME

- Building rpm/debs for projects
- Building rpms/debs for whole virtualenvs
- Building macOS installers for Python projects
- Building Android APKs with Kivy+P4A or P4A & Buildozer
Windows

- Building Windows installers for Python projects
Pynsist
Pynsist is a tool that bundles Python programs together with the Python-interpreter into a single installer based on NSIS. In most cases, packaging only requires the user to choose a version of the Python-interpreter and declare the dependencies of the program. The tool downloads the specified Python-interpreter for Windows and packages it with all the dependencies in a single Windows-executable installer.

The installed program can be started from a shortcut that the installer adds to the start-menu. It uses a Python interpreter installed within its application directory, independent of any other Python installation on the computer.

A big advantage of Pynsist is that the Windows packages can be built on Linux. There are several examples for different kinds of programs (console, GUI) in the documentation. The tool is released under the MIT-licence.

// .split() splits the data into an array based on the argument provided which tells it where to make the splits. We want the individual characters so an empty string is passed as the argument.
const characters = page.split("");

// Square brackets in .match takes a group
const lettersAndNumbers = characters.filter(char => {
    if(char.match(/[a-z]/)) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
